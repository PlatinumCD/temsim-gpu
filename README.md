# TEMSIM-GPU

temsim-gpu is a collection of GPU-accelerated simulations for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This project includes implementations using CUDA, HIP, and SYCL for different hardware platforms.

## Implementations

- temsim-cuda: CUDA-based implementation for NVIDIA GPUs.
- temsim-hip: HIP-based implementation for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.
- temsim-sycl: SYCL-based implementation for cross-platform support.

Each implementation has its own README.md with further instructions on setup and usage.

## License

Licensing details are pending and will be updated soon.
